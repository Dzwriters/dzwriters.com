**DzWriters Community** Across various platforms is a participatory way for Algerians to share their knowledge and experience with others. **The DzWriters Community** allows us to connect with each other, learn from each other, and build projects of mutual benefit.

To stay informed of our work, we recommend that you subscribe to our mailing list and follow us on various social networks. Through this we try to jot down the information that we are discussing on different platforms to make it available to more people.

 The DzWriters community site is hosted on github, which enables anyone to contribute to its content and enrich it further.
 
The idea of **DzWriters** started on the clubhouse platform and is developing day by day to include the rest of the platforms. If you want to be part of this community, and done in the spirit of participation, we invite you to join the **DzWriters community** where you will find all the support through the following form:
