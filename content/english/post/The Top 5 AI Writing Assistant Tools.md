# The Top 5 AI Writing Assistant Tools to Help You Write Faster and Better

**AI writing assistant tools** are applications that use artificial intelligence to help you write **better** and **faster**. They do this by analyzing your text and providing feedback on areas where you could improve your writing. This feedback can include suggestions on grammar, vocabulary, and style.

AI writing assistant tools can be a great help if you want to improve your writing skills. They can make you more aware of the mistakes you make, and teach you how to avoid them. Additionally, they can give you feedback on how to improve the readability and impact of your writing. However, the cost of such a tool can vary depending on the features offered. Some writing assistants have free trials, while others may charge a lot.

In this article, we will take a look more specifically at some of the best Natural language generation (NLG) tools available and how they can help you write **better** and **faster**.

# Let’s first start by what is Natural language generation (NLG)?

Natural language generation (NLG) is the process of transforming data into natural language or human-readable text. This can be done in a number of ways, but typically, NLG tools use artificial intelligence to analyze data and then generate text that is relevant to that data.

There are a number of different NLG tools available, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, all of these tools share one common goal: to help you write better content.

Comparing the Cost of Different Tools

The cost of the ai writing assistant tools can vary depending on the features that are offered. Some of the more basic tools may be less expensive, while more comprehensive tools that include additional features such as plagiarism detection may be more expensive. However, in this comparison, I have tried to compare them based on the basic paid offers and the estimation of cost by 1000 words. With credits and generations, it is difficult to estimate the number of words. OpenAI is clearly much less expensive compared to other solutions. But it is generally believed that the ai writing assistant tools are more affordable than hiring a professional writer.
